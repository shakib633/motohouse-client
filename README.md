* Home page has a  navbar, banner, a maximum of 6 items, a footer, and two extra sections named 'why you choose us, about'.
* Every item has a relevant name, image, short description, price, quantity, supplier name, dealer name and an update button.
* Clicking on the update button will take the user to the inventory/:id route. This route will be a private/protected route.
* If the user is not logged in, the private route redirects to the login page . After login, the user will be redirected to the page he/she wanted to go to. After reloading the page of a private route, the user is not redirected to the login page.
* ON the Manage Inventories page, there is a button named Add New Item. User can add an inventory item page by clicking on this button.
* Email password-based authentication and at least one social login(google) authentication. If the user is logged in, the sign-out button will appear on the header, the user will sign out if the user clicked the sign-out button. If the user is logged in, he/she will see more options Manage Items, Add Item, My items, and Logout.
*  On the My Items page, the logged-in user will see only his/her Items. If the user wants, he/she should be able to delete any item.
 Ask for a confirmation message before deleting an item. 
And anyone will be able to delete an item either from the Manage Inventories page.
* Also added two more routes. one route is Blogs and the other is service. I answered three questions on the blog page. This route is not a protected route. 
* I created a 404 page (not found page)
* Display error when user email address or password don't match.
* Add a link for Password reset.
* The full website is responsive.
* I used react boostarp,firebase, heroku, node js, mongodb ,reactjs
